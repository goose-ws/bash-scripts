# Bash Script Collection

## About

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts designed for various automation and utility tasks. These scripts are primarily passion projects. I have a moderate amount of skill in bash. I am certainly no expert, but I am no novice either. There are likely better ways to execute the flow of logic I am trying to achieve in these scripts! If you have a suggestion, I would welcome a pull request. All scripts require **Bash version 4 or greater** to run.

**Please do not use or expect anything from the 'testing' branch to work. Only scripts from the 'main' branch are polished enough to be expected to work reliably.**

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please raise an issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/goose-ws/bash-scripts/issues) for the repository.

For bugs, feature requests, and enhancements, reach out via the [Issues page](https://github.com/goose-ws/bash-scripts/issues). If you just need support, reach out to me on IRC. I idle in `#goose` on: [irc://irc.ChatSpike.net/#goose](ChatSpike), [irc://irc.Libera.chat/#goose](Libera), [irc://irc.oftc.net/#goose](OFTC), [irc://irc.slashnet.org/#goose](SlashNet), and [irc://irc.SnooNet.org/#goose](SnooNet). I usually respond within a few hours of being highlighted.

## Scripts

Below is a list of scripts available in this repository, along with their descriptions, requirements, and installation instructions.

These scripts will generally work by sourcing the "Config" options to a `.env` file with the same base file name, and kept in the same directory.

So for example, if you want to use the `captive-dns.bash` script, you will need to place `captive-dns.env` in the same directory next to it.

The config file names are dynamic to the script file name. So if you wanted to rename `captive-dns.bash` to `force-dns.bash`, then your config file would need to be `force-dns.env` in the same directory.

## Dependencies

While the dependencies vary for each script, many depend on [Mike Farah's 'yq'](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). While `jq` is great for json, I've found `yq` to better suit my needs, as it allows me to parse XML in the same way. There are some that still use `jq` as I wrote them before switching to `yq` -- I am likely to edit them in the future to depend on `yq` instead.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Contributing
I welcome any discussion and pull requests, as outlined above. I wrote these scripts for myself, but I'm sharing them with the world, as perhaps they can be useful to others in the same way that they've been useful to me. Scripts in this repository will always be freely available.

If you happen to find these scripts particularly helpful and have a few bucks to spare, you can [https://github.com/sponsors/goose-ws](buy me a drink)! No pressure at all, but any support is greatly appreciated!

* **Requirements**:
    * UDM Pro running Unifi v2.4+ (Debian-based)
    * BoostChicken's [on-boot.d](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/tree/main/on-boot-script-2.x)
    * Dependencies: `awk`, `curl`, `date`, `grep`, `host`, `md5sum`, `iptables`, `sort`
* **Installation**:
    1.  Ensure BoostChicken's on-boot functionality is installed.
    2.  Place the script at `/data/scripts/captive-dns.bash` on your UDM Pro.

### Sonarr Update TBA (`sonarr-update-tba.bash`)

* **Purpose**: Checks your Sonarr library for files that were imported with "TBA" titles and attempts to rename them by refreshing metadata once the actual episode titles are available. This script is intended to run on the host system, interacting with Sonarr running in Docker.
* **Requirements**:
    * Docker (if Sonarr is Dockerized)
    * Dependencies: `awk`, `curl`, `docker`, `jq`, `md5sum`
    * Sonarr setting "Episode Title Requires" should be set to "Only for Bulk Season Releases" or "Never" to allow importing TBA titled episodes.
* **Installation**:
    1.  Download the `.bash` script and the `.env.example` file to your host system.
    2.  Rename `sonarr-update-tba.env.example` to `sonarr-update-tba.env` and customize it with your Sonarr details.
    3.  Set the script to run via a cron job (e.g., hourly).
* **Features**:
    * Identifies files with "TBA" or "TBD" in their names within Sonarr's library paths.
    * Triggers a series refresh and then a rename command in Sonarr for the affected series/episodes.
    * Telegram and Discord notifications for renamed items or errors.
    * Self-update capability (`-u` or `--update`).
    * Supports multiple Sonarr instances if they are Docker-based; single host-based instance also supported.
    * Ignore lists for libraries, series, and episodes.
    * Manages a lockfile to prevent concurrent execution.

### Unifi Client Monitor (`unifi_client_monitor.bash`)

* **Purpose**: Monitors `/var/log/daemon.log` on a Unifi device (likely a UDM) for DHCPACK entries, logs new client connections to an SQLite database, and sends Telegram notifications for newly seen clients or MAC addresses.
* **Requirements**:
    * `yq` (will attempt to download if missing)
    * `sqlite3` (will attempt to `apt install` if missing)
    * Dependencies: `curl`, `date`, `sqlite3`, `yq`
* **Installation**:
    1.  Download the `.bash` script and `unifi_client_monitor.env.example`.
    2.  Rename `unifi_client_monitor.env.example` to `unifi_client_monitor.env` and customize with Telegram bot details and local DNS server IP.
    3.  Place both files in a suitable directory on your Unifi device.
    4.  Make the script executable: `chmod +x unifi_client_monitor.bash`.
    5.  Run the script; it will background itself to continuously monitor the log. Consider using [on-boot.d](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/tree/main/on-boot-script-2.x) for persistance.
* **Features**:
    * Continuously monitors `/var/log/daemon.log` for new DHCP leases.
    * Logs new client details (VLAN, MAC, IP, Name from DHCP, Timestamp) to an SQLite database (`.unifi_client_monitor.db`).
    * Sends a Telegram notification when a new client (or a known MAC with a new IP/VLAN) is detected.
    * Checks against a local DNS server for a hostname associated with the new IP address.
    * Indicates if the MAC address has been seen before.
    * Manages a lockfile to prevent concurrent execution of the main script (the monitoring part runs in the background).
