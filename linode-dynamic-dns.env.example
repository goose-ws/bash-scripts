# This is an array, so you can do multiple channels if you want.
# Format is: ("-100xxxxxxx2" "-100xxxxxxx1")
# Modifiers include threads for super groups, and silent notifications.
# If sending to a super group thread, you can specify the thread by adding '&message_thread_id=[int]',
# where [int] is the interger of the thread ID. (e.g. "-100xxxxxxxxx1&message_thread_id=12")
# For silent notifications, you can add the modifier '&silent=true' (e.g. "-100xxxxxxxxx1&silent=true")

# If you enabled Telegram messages for script errors, you can define a different channel for errors to
# be sent to, instead of the ones defined in the 'telegramChannelId' array above. This can only be a single
# channel, not an array. If you leave this blank, and have error messages enabled, then they will send to
# all channels in the 'telegramChannelId' array above.
