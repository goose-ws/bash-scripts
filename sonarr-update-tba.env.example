# The Sonarr instances you want to interact with. 
# If you are running Sonarr via Docker, you can use 'docker:<container_name>' to let the script automatically figure out the IP address
#   e.g. if your container name is 'sonarr', then containerIp=("docker:sonarr")
#   For multiple Sonarr instances, just add additional array items, e.g. containerIp=("docker:sonarr" "docker:sonarr-4k")
# If your instance is hosted on your system, you could just provide a direct IPv4 address, assuming it is valid/static
#   e.g. if your instance is reachable via localhost, then containerIp=("127.0.0.1")
#   Currently multiple Sonarr instances outside of Docker are unsupported. If you have multiple instances running on your host, create
#   an issue and I'll try and motivate myself to add support for your situation.
## This is an array
containerIp=("docker:sonarr" "docker:sonarr-4k")

# If your Sonarr instance is not provided via Docker, you must uncomment the below variable and point to where your 'config.xml' for Sonarr is
## This is a string
#sonarrConfig="/path/to/your/sonarr/config.xml"

# Are we allowed to check for and notify of updates each time the script runs?
# Can be "Yes" "No" "True" "False"
## This is a string
updateCheck="Yes"

# How verbose should our output be?
# Possible values:
# 1 - Error only
# 2 - Informational
# 3 - Verbose
## This is a string
outputVerbosity="2"

# If you have entire libraries you want to ignore, you can run the script with verbose output, and watch for the
# line "Detected [int] libraries", then put the correspnding library ID into this array to have it ignored on future runs.
# If you have multiple Sonarr containers running in Docker, you should prefix the ID with the container
# you want it to correspond to, for example instead of:
#     ignoreLibraryArr=("123")
# you would do:
#     ignoreLibraryArr=("docker:sonarr:123")
## This is an array
ignoreLibrary=()

# If you have entire series you want to ignore, you can run the script with verbose output, and watch for the
# line "Found series ID:", then put the series ID into this array to have it ignored on future runs.
# If you have multiple Sonarr containers running in Docker, you should prefix the ID with the container
# you want it to correspond to, for example instead of:
#     ignoreSeries=("456")
# you would do:
#     ignoreSeries=("docker:sonarr:456")
## This is an array
ignoreSeries=()

# If you have files you want to ignore, you can run the script with verbose output, and watch for the
# line "Found episode ID:", then put the episode ID into this array to have it ignored on future runs.
# If you have multiple Sonarr containers running in Docker, you should prefix the ID with the container
# you want it to correspond to, for example instead of:
#     ignoreEpisodes=("789")
# you would do:
#     ignoreEpisodes=("docker:sonarr:789")
## This is an array
ignoreEpisodes=()
