# YouTube Data v3 API key
# Technically optional, but if you do not use your own, you'll use the free API service provided via LemnosLife.
# Because that is a freely provided service, calls to it will be throttled, and the script will run much slower.
# To reduce burden on that free service, and greatly improve the speed of API calls, better to use your own API key.
# To generate your own API key:
# 1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
# 2. Create a new project
# 3. Select newly created project
# 4. Go to "APIs & Services"
# 5. Go to "Enable APIs and services"
# 6. Search for "youtube data api v3"
# 7. Click on "youtube data api v3"
# 8. Click "Enable"
# 9. Click "Create credentials"
# 10. Click "API Key"
# 11. Copy the API key, paste it into the array below
# Each free project's API key gets 10,000 requests per day. One API key is probably fine for most people, but if you want to
# create additional projects and add additional API keys, the script will rotate to the next if it receives a response
# of 'max use exceeded'. Just remember to create new proejcts for more API keys, not multiple API keys for the same project.
## This is an array

# A netscape cookie file authenticating you to YouTube

# Set the minimum and maximum range of seconds that we should wait after calling yt-dlp.

# IP address where the Plex Media Server can be reached
# If Plex is in Docker, this can be 'docker:container-name' to automatically find the container's IP address
# For example, plexIp="docker:plex"
# If it's a host based (or remote?) system, you can directly input the IP address
# For example, plexIp="127.0.0.1"
# If the IP address could be dynamic, or you want to obtain it some other way (e.g. your Plex runs in Kube),
# you can set it to a subshell that should return only the bare IP address
# For example, plexIp="$(dig +short 'some.domain.name')" or plexIp="$(kubectl -n media get svc/plex -ojson)"
## This is a string
plexIp="docker:plex"

# A staging area with enough space for us to download/work with videos, before moving them to their final destination
# This will create its own temp directory within your specified directory, and then clean it up afterwards. So there's
# really no need to do something like "${HOME}/tmp", it can just be "${HOME}". You'll just want to make sure it's 
# somewhere that has enough space.

# If you want to send a Telegram message notifying of renamed items, fill them out.
# Telegram bot API key, obtained from @BotFather

# https://gist.github.com/goose-ws/1c82c98ac4701af433eb5c7562109e51
# This is an array, so you can do multiple channels if you want.
# Format is: ("-100xxxxxxx2" "-100xxxxxxx1")
# Modifiers include threads for super groups, and silent notifications.
# If sending to a super group thread, you can specify the thread by adding '&message_thread_id=[int]',
# where [int] is the interger of the thread ID. (e.g. "-100xxxxxxxxx1&message_thread_id=12")
# For silent notifications, you can add the modifier '&silent=true' (e.g. "-100xxxxxxxxx1&silent=true")
## This is an array
telegramChannelId=("")

# Do you want to send a Telegram message for script errors? Beware, the script is not capable of checking
# to see if an error message has already been sent, so depending on your cron settings this could become
# very spammy. Can be "Yes" "No" "True" "False"
## This is a string
telegramErrorMessages=""

# If you enabled Telegram messages for script errors, you can define a different channel for errors to
# be sent to, instead of the ones defined in the 'telegramChannelId' array above. This can only be a single
# channel, not an array. If you leave this blank, and have error messages enabled, then they will send to
# all channels in the 'telegramChannelId' array above.
## This is a string
