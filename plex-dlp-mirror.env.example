# YouTube Data v3 API key
# Technically optional, but if you do not use your own, you'll use the free API service provided via LemnosLife.
# Because that is a freely provided service, calls to it will be throttled, and the script will run much slower.
# To reduce burden on that free service, and greatly improve the speed of API calls, better to use your own API key.
# To generate your own API key:
# 1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
# 2. Create a new project
# 3. Select newly created project
# 4. Go to "APIs & Services"
# 5. Go to "Enable APIs and services"
# 6. Search for "youtube data api v3"
# 7. Click on "youtube data api v3"
# 8. Click "Enable"
# 9. Click "Create credentials"
# 10. Click "API Key"
# 11. Copy the API key, paste it into the array below
# Each free project's API key gets 10,000 requests per day. One API key is probably fine for most people, but if you want to
# create additional projects and add additional API keys, the script will rotate to the next if it receives a response
# of 'max use exceeded'. Just remember to create new proejcts for more API keys, not multiple API keys for the same project.

# A netscape cookie file authenticating you to YouTube
# Optional, but needed for private videos and playlists
# Also useful to avoid captcha blocking, see https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/10128

# Set the minimum and maximum range of seconds that we should wait after calling yt-dlp.
# Useful to avoid IP bans, see https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/10108
# A minimum of 30 and maximum of 120 seem to have been safe for me, but that's no guarantee.
# Set both to zero to disable.

# If you're spawning via cron, we can add an optional sleep when the script is spawned but before we start executing calls, 
# to prevent our actions from appearing too programatic. If you want to do this, set a maximum sleep time (in seconds), and
# a sleep timer will be set for a random number between 1 and your maximum number. Note that this can be longer than your cron
# interval, because the script will not run if the lockfile is present. So let's sa yyou can run the script hourly via cron,
# but set the max sleep for 2 hours. The script spawns at 13:00 and picks a random sleeps for 68 minutes. At 14:00 the script
# spawns, but the lockfile is present, so that spawn exits.
# Leave this blank to disable it.

# IP address where the Plex Media Server can be reached
# If Plex is in Docker, this can be 'docker:container-name' to automatically find the container's IP address
# For example, plexIp="docker:plex"
# If it's a host based (or remote?) system, you can directly input the IP address
# For example, plexIp="127.0.0.1"
# If the IP address could be dynamic, or you want to obtain it some other way (e.g. your Plex runs in Kube),
# you can set it to a subshell that should return only the bare IP address
# For example, plexIp="$(dig +short 'some.domain.name')" --or-- plexIp="$(kubectl -n media get svc/plex -ojson)"

## This is an array, so you can do multiple channels if you want.
# Format is: ("-100xxxxxxx2" "-100xxxxxxx1")
# Modifiers include threads for super groups, and silent notifications.
# If sending to a super group thread, you can specify the thread by adding '&message_thread_id=[int]',
# where [int] is the interger of the thread ID. (e.g. "-100xxxxxxxxx1&message_thread_id=12")
# For silent notifications, you can add the modifier '&silent=true' (e.g. "-100xxxxxxxxx1&silent=true")
## This is an array

# Do you want to send a Telegram message for script errors? Beware, the script is not capable of checking
# to see if an error message has already been sent, so depending on your cron settings this could become
# very spammy. Can be "Yes" "No" "True" "False"
telegramErrorMessages=""

# If you enabled Telegram messages for script errors, you can define a different channel for errors to
# be sent to, instead of the ones defined in the 'telegramChannelId' array above. This can only be a single
# channel, not an array. If you leave this blank, and have error messages enabled, then they will send to
# all channels in the 'telegramChannelId' array above.
